# interactive-accessibility

## What accessibility enhancements were the most challenging to implement, and why?
The most challenging was managing the outline on input focus because browsers add system styles that override custom border-color, making it tricky to control visual focus clearly.

## How do ARIA attributes improve the experience for users relying on assistive technologies?
ARIA attributes help users with disabilities by providing extra information about elements, making the page easier to navigate and understand.

## What tools did you use to check color contrast, and how did they help?
Used https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/ to quickly check color contrast and ensure accessibility.
